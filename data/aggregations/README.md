NO LAG OPTION
- Proportions of major/minor/micro/no change updates to reach no lag

MAJOR/MINOR/MICRO LAG
- Stories for update strategies (e.g. doing micro updates but still having minor lag)


LAG STATISTICS
- We really want to keep all values of lag amounts and times so we can run descriptive statistics on them - not just doing averages.

We really want to know for each lag type, if there is major and minor and micro lag - rather than major masking the smaller types of lag.
